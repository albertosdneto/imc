## Description
Flutter App to calculate basic mass index and store it at local database. 
This was my first app with flutter and it will remain here, the way it is, for historical purpose, so I can compare both my code and interface evolution along the months.

## Goals of this projet

The main goal is to learn and practice Flutter/Dart.

## What I have learned so far:
- Creating app layout
- First steps with SQLite
- Adding an Icon do the App
- Adding SplashScreen to the app
- Charts
- Using Image Assets Studio to prepare icons
- How important it is to read the official documentation before going for tutorials
