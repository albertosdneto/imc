# IMC

Flutter App to calculate basic mass index and store it at local database.



## Goals of this projet

The main goal is to learn and practice Flutter/Dart.

## What I have learned so far:
- Creating app layout
- First steps with SQLite
- Adding an Icon do the App
- Adding SplashScreen to the app
- How important it is to read the official documentation before going for tutorials
